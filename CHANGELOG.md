All notable changes to agent-fleet are recorded here. Entries are grouped by
development **Phase** (per `docs/design.md`) until the first tagged release.

## [Unreleased]

### Phase 1 — skeleton + `fleet init` (2026-05-19)

Bootstrap the repository so a minimal `fleet init` works end-to-end.

- Repository skeleton:
  - `./fleet` — executable Python entrypoint (shebang, `git clone` and run, no `pip install`)
  - `src/fleet/` — Python package (`cli`, `state`, `commands/init`)
  - `tests/` — stdlib `unittest`-based smoke tests
  - `docs/design.md` — design document carried over from claude-forge
  - `.gitignore`, `README.md`
- Command:
  - `fleet init --name <name> [path]` — creates `.fleet-state/` with
    `project.yaml`, empty `events.jsonl`, empty `tasks/`. Rejects already-initialized
    projects and non-directory paths.
- Python 3.11+ required; no third-party dependencies (vendored libs land in later phases).
